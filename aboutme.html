                Hi, I'm AJ Hall! I am a soon to be high school graduate trained in the Information Technology field. I
                am
                from Dayton, Ohio. My passion is computers. I started when I was 9 years old and found some computer
                videos
                on youtube, I haven't looked back since. Nearly 10 years later, I'm proud to say I've experienced so
                many
                important and incredible things. I've even got to create a lot of interesting things. You can check out
                my
                works page on my linkedin!
                I have about a year of professional experience in the computer repair field. One of the reasons my
                customers
                love my service is I work with each person on the price depending on what they want done and how quickly
                they want it done. Another reason people love to work with or for me is because I consider myself a
                "forever
                student," I'm eager to both build on my academic foundations in computer science, and stay in tune with
                the
                latest digital breakthroughs by continued coursework.
            </p>
            <p class="aboutMeParagraph">
                My hunger for knowledge and determination has led to my success at my current position where I have
                received
                several awards as well as promotions. I believe mindfulness in the workplace is the key to success in
                everything I've accomplished. I am currently looking for any opportunities in the information technology
                field near Dayton, Ohio. If I am of interest to you please contact me today so we can set a time to
                speak
                together!
